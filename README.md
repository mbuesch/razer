Razer device configuration tool
===============================

[https://bues.ch/h/razercfg](https://bues.ch/h/razercfg)

This is a configuration utility for Razer devices on Linux systems.

Supported devices
-----------------

Device support table at [https://bues.ch/h/razercfg#device_support](https://bues.ch/h/razercfg#device_support)

Dependencies
------------

* Python 3.x: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)  
  Debian Linux: `apt-get install python3`

* libusb 1.0: [http://libusb.org/](http://libusb.org/)   
Debian Linux: `apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev`

* PySide (for the graphical qrazercfg tool only): [https://wiki.qt.io/PySide](https://wiki.qt.io/PySide)  
Debian Linux: `apt-get install python3-pyside`

* cmake 2.4 or later (for building only): [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/)  
Debian Linux: `apt-get install cmake`

Note that almost all distributions ship prebuilt packages of the
above dependencies.

If you installed a dependency after you already ran `cmake .` and/or `make`, it
might happen that the dependency is still not found. Just delete the cmake
status files or unpack a clean razercfg tarball to workaround this issue.


Building
--------

First invoke `cmake` to build the makefiles.
Then invoke `make` to build the binaries:

<pre>
cmake .
make
</pre>

(Note the required space and dot after the cmake command)

Installing
----------

First you need to install the tool libraries and binaries. Do this by executing
the following command as root:

<pre>
make install
</pre>

Be aware that `make install` installs the shared library `librazer.so` to `$PREFIX/lib`.
The default `$PREFIX` is `/usr/local/`, but the install prefix can also be changed via `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='<somewhere>'`.
You have to make sure that `librazer.so` in `$PREFIX/lib/` can be found by the dynamic linker `ld.so`.
Your operating system most likely already has support for libraries in `/usr/local/lib`. So on most systems you don't have to do anything.
If this is not the case, or you installed razercfg somewhere else, a new library search path can be added via `/etc/ld.so.conf` or `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/`.
See your operating system manual for further information.

### If you use **systemd**:

The `make install` step installed the razerd.service file. Reboot or run the
following command as root to start the razerd daemon:

<pre>
systemctl start razerd
</pre>

### If you do **not** use systemd:

To automatically start the required system daemon `razerd` at bootup time, you
need to install the init-script. This software package includes a generic
example script, that should work out-of-the-box on many Linux distributions. To
install it, invoke the following commands as root:

<pre>
cp ./razerd.initscript /etc/init.d/razerd
ln -s /etc/init.d/razerd /etc/rc2.d/S99razerd
ln -s /etc/init.d/razerd /etc/rc5.d/S99razerd
ln -s /etc/init.d/razerd /etc/rc0.d/K01razerd
ln -s /etc/init.d/razerd /etc/rc6.d/K01razerd
</pre>

### If you use **udev**:

The `make install` step installed the udev script to
<pre>
$(pkg-config --variable=udevdir udev)/rules.d/80-razer.rules
</pre>
This should work on most distributions.

If udev notification does not work, try to reboot the system.

RazerD Configuration
--------------------

The user may create a razerd configuration file in `/etc/razer.conf` which can be
used to specify various razerd options and initial hardware configuration
settings.
An example config file is included as `razer.conf` in this package.
If no configuration file is available, razerd will work with default settings.

X Window System (X.ORG) Configuration
-------------------------------------

If you don't have an xorg.conf, you don't have to do anything and it should work
out-of-the-box.

X must _not_ be configured to a specific mouse device like `/dev/input/mouse0`. On
configuration events, razerd may have to temporarily unregister the mouse from
the system. This will confuse X, if it's configured to a specific device.
Configure it to the generic `/dev/input/mice` device instead. This will enable X
to pick up the mouse again after a configuration event from razerd.

Example xorg.conf snippet:

<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier	"Mouse"
    Driver	"mouse"
    Option	"Device" "/dev/input/mice"
EndSection
</pre>

Alternatively, do not specify a `"Device"` at all. X will autodetect the device
then:

<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier	"Mouse"
    Driver	"mouse"
EndSection
</pre>

In any case, do _NOT_ use: `Option "Device" "/dev/input/mouseX"`

Using the tools
---------------

To use the tools, the razerd daemon needs to be started as root, first. Without
the background daemon, nothing will work. The daemon is responsible for doing
the lowlevel hardware accesses and for tracking the current state of the device.
While the daemon is running, the user interfaces `razercfg` (commandline) and
`qrazercfg` (graphical user interface) can be used.

Uninstalling
------------

If you installed razercfg with your distribution packaging system, use that to
uninstall razercfg.

If you compiled razercfg from source and installed it with `make install`, you
can use the `uninstall.sh` script from the razercfg archive to uninstall
razercfg from the system. It must be called with the install prefix as its first
argument. That usually is `/usr/local`, unless specified otherwise in cmake. A
call to uninstall.sh might look like this:

<pre>
./uninstall.sh /usr/local
</pre>

Architecture
------------

The architecture layout of the razer tools looks like this:

<pre>

                           -----------                        | |
                          | qrazercfg |-----------------------^ |
                           -----------                          |

                            --------------------------          |

                           ---------------------------
</pre>

So in general, your application wants to access the razer devices through
pyrazer or (if it's not a python app) through librazerd.
(Note that librazerd is not written, yet. So currently the only way to access
the devices is through pyrazer).
Applications should never poke with lowlevel librazer directly, because there
will be no instance that keeps track of the device state and permissions and
concurrency.
